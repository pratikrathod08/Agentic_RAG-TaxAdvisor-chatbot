From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in \\nterms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated to be around \\n25%-30%. Introduction of GST would also make Indian products competitive in the domestic and \\ninternational markets.

The taxable event in each case is different. However, the major \\nsources of income of Government from taxation are from excise duty levied on manufacture of \\ngoods, customs duty levied on importation of goods, service tax levied on rendering of service and \\nVAT levied on sale of goods. The entries in List I, List II and List III of Schedule VII of \\nConstitution of India provide power to Central or State Government to levy tax.    \\n \\nThe Central Government did not have power to levy tax on sale of goods and the State \\nGovernments did not have power to levy duty/tax on manufactures of goods or rendering of service. \\nTherefore, Constitution of India has been amended to provide powers to both Central Government \\nand State Governments to levy tax on goods and services on activities.'],\n",

    "At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:\n",
    "- State: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any data type, but is typically defined using a shared state schema.\n",
    "- Nodes: Functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current state as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated state.\n",
    "- Edges: Functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current state. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions."

      "GST (Goods and Services Tax) is India’s nationwide indirect tax on the supply of goods and services, introduced on 1 July 2017 by the Constitution (101st Amendment) Act to replace multiple central and state taxes. It is governed by the GST Council (chaired by the Finance Minister), aims to create a unified common market, and works as a value‑added tax with input tax credits so only value addition is taxed from manufacturer to consumer. Standard rates are 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, with special rates of 0.25% on rough precious/semi‑precious stones and 3% on gold, plus a cess over 28% on select items. By definition it excludes alcoholic liquor for human consumption; five petroleum products and electricity are also outside GST (petroleum products temporarily).\n"
